# Todo App Using React 

![Todo App](./Pictures/Todo.jpg)


This project is a Todo Application built with a frontend and backend. It allows users to add todos with a title and description, and displays the list of todos. Each todo item has a status that can be toggled between 'Completed' and 'Not Completed'. This application is a great way to keep track of tasks and their completion status.
